### Background

Data scientist with a BSc in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Stirling and an MSc in Data Science from the University of Edinburgh. I'm excited about cutting-edge text technologies, bioinformatics, and deep learning. One of my favorite projects was developing a patient movement forecasting tool for a local hospital during the pandemic.

With over five years in the marketing world, I've tackled everything from AB testing and customer segmentation to journey optimization and marketing channel attribution. At WPP, I worked magic on Ford campaigns, and at Assembly, I crafted data solutions for big names like Nike and ACE Hardware, including a sleek attribution dashboard and a massive MMM project.

Now, I'm diving into freelancing and creating a data journalism portfolio that highlights issues close to my heart. Always eager for the next data adventure!
