## Background
I graduated from the University of Stirling with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Computer Science. I worked in a world-famous WPP marketing firm for over 3 years on Ford client, first as a Data Analyst, working with campaign AB testing, customer segmentation, journey optimisation, and product launches; then as a Data Scientist, automating our reporting and analytics, creating data pipelines and working on marketing channel attribution analysis. 

Wanting to improve my understanding and data skills, I went on to graduate from the University of Edinburgh with an MSc in Data Science. I loved working with the latest text technologies, as well as understanding the basics of Bioinformatics, and using deep learning. For my thesis, I worked with a local Edinburgh hospital to create a tool that forecasts the movements of patients between wards for easy decision-making and planning. I found this project very meaningful to me as this work was done at the height of the coronavirus pandemic. 

At Assembly, a global marketing agency I worked with a variety of big clients to provide diverse and tailored data solutions, such as the Attribution dashboard for Nike. I also worked on a large MMM project for the ACE hardware store chain in the US. I'm grateful for this role since I've learned a lot, most of all, what I want to learn and move towards in my career.

### Current Work

I'm working as a freelancer and with open-source data to create a data journalism portfolio about the current issues that impact me.
